#       Accessing ingress services using a browser:
# Entering the httpbin service URL in a browser won’t work because you can’t pass the Host header to a browser like you did with curl. 
# In a real world situation, this is not a problem because you configure the requested host properly and DNS resolvable. 
# Thus, you use the host’s domain name in the URL, for example, https://httpbin.example.com/status/200.   

# You can work around this problem for simple tests and demos as follows:

apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: httpbin-gateway
spec:
  # The selector matches the ingress gateway pod labels.
  # If you installed Istio using Helm following the standard documentation, this would be "istio=ingress"
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "*"
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: httpbin
spec:
  hosts:
  - "*"
  gateways:
  - httpbin-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        prefix: /headers
    route:
    - destination:
        port:
          number: 8000
        host: httpbin
        

# You can then use $INGRESS_HOST:$INGRESS_PORT in the browser URL. 
# For example, http://$INGRESS_HOST:$INGRESS_PORT/headers will display all the headers that your browser sends.
